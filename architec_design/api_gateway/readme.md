```bash
What is an API gateway?
An API gateway is like a receptionist for a building. When someone (a client) needs to access something in the building (the backend services), they go through the receptionist.

This receptionist helps by directing them to the right room, making sure they have permission to enter, and even keeping track of how many people are entering or leaving to avoid overcrowding.

It handles things like security, traffic control, and making sure everything runs smoothly, all while simplifying the visitor's experience.
